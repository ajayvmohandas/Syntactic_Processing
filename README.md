## General Information
- What is the background of your project?

‘BeHealthy’,a health tech company has a web platform that allows doctors to list their services and manage patient interactions and provides services for patients such as booking interactions with doctors and ordering medicines online. Here, doctors can easily organise appointments, track past medical records and provide e-prescriptions.

The company wants to build Continuous Random Field (CRF) model to After that, you need to create a dictionary in which diseases are keys and treatments are values.

There are eight major tasks that you need to perform to complete the assignment. They are as follows:

Data preprocessing
Concept identification
Defining the features for CRF
Getting the features words and sentences
Defining input and target variables
Building the model
Evaluating the model
Identifying the diseases and predicted treatment using a custom NER.


- What is the dataset that is being used?

There are four datasets provided to you to process, which are as follows:

- train_sent
- test_sent
- train_label
- test_label

You have the train and the test datasets; the train dataset is used to train the CRF model, and the test dataset is used to evaluate the built model.

## Conclusions

- A dictionary is created in which diseases are keys and treatments are values.
